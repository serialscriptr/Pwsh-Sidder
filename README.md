# Pwsh-Sidder
Sidder, re-created in powershell

Due to the lack of a compiled release of the [original sidder application](https://github.com/msfreaks/Sidder) I decided to recreate it from scratch within powershell. Designed specifically for powershell core but should be compatible with windows powershell too. Also check out this continuation of the original sidder project [here](https://github.com/MarkusDick/SidderPlus)

## To be added later
- Context menu for interacting with UPD. Example action: open file path or mount UPD
- See if there is another way to find the user assigned to the UPD based on ACL or something else
- Export Options
- Different options for how the file size displays (ex kb, mb, gb)

## Known issues
- Column cell value sorting via clicking column header doesn't sort last modified or file size columns correctly

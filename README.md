# Pwsh-Sidder
Sidder, re-created in powershell

Due to the lack of a compiled release of the [original sidder application](https://github.com/msfreaks/Sidder) I decided to recreate it from scratch within powershell. Designed specifically for powershell core but should be compatible with windows powershell too.

## Improvements upon the original
- Locked/in use user profile disks show highlighted in light red

## To be added later
- Context menu for interacting with UPD. Example action: open file path or mount UPD
- See if there is another way to find the user assigned to the UPD based on ACL or something else

## Known issues
- Column cell value sorting via clicking column header doesn't sort last modified or file size columns correctly
